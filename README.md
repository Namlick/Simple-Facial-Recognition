# Simple-Facial-Recognition
Perform simple facial recognition tasks using OpenCV and the widely used face-recognition Python library. 

Steps to train and use this facial recognition repository.

1. Open the Datasets folder and rename the your_name file to your name, and delete the dummy file inside. 

2. Open headshots.py or headshots_picam.py (if using a picamera) and change the name to your name.

3. Run the headshots.py or headshots_picam.py code and use the space bar to take pictures of your face from multiple angles. Exit the code by pressing q.

4. Run the train_model.py code.

5. Run the facial_req_simple.py code and observe as it draws a bounding box around your face and labels it with your name.
